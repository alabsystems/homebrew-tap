  # Same artifact as the `aterm` cask on purpose: aterm IS ALab's front door —
  # the toolchain is one `aterm pkg install --default-set` away, and `brew
  # install alab` should land people there. Casks have no alias mechanism, so
  # this is a real cask; the conflict keeps the two from double-installing.
